# Test scripts for infinite series truncation algorithms
Preliminary code to test truncation algorithms for infinite series and their applications in Statistics.

- The importance of selecting the right algorithm: as [this](https://github.com/maxbiostat/truncation_tests/blob/main/tests/adaptive_versus_threshold.r) script demonstrates, when L > 1/2 one really ought to use the error-bounding ("adaptive") algorithm.
